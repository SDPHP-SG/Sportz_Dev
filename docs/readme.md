The "docs" directory contains documentation and files related to the creation of the Sportz web site.  This is where you would put files that aren't necessary for the actual running of the site.

The CI_app_flow files are my attempt at showing the flow from beginning to end of how the CI app processes and what variables/objects are available at the different points in the program.  I created them by running CI and stepping thru with the debugger. I will continue to refine and complete them as I have time.

The "database" folder contains files for creating the database as well as live and sample data.  It also contains the output of any visual tools used.

The "git" folder contains any documentation or files related to git, but not the git repository itself.

The "usecase" folder contains any use-case files which detail different scenarios for how a user might use the site.

The "wireframe" folder may contain wireframes of the various pages which a designer can modify.  They are generally created in adobe fireworks.
